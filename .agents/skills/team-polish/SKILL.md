# Team Polish

## Codex Interaction Contract

- Ask one decision question per turn and wait for the answer before asking another.
- Use `request_user_input` for structured choices when it is available; otherwise ask the same concise question directly.
- Use Codex custom agents by role and profile when delegation is useful.
- Treat any approved write as one complete proposed changeset. Before writing, present every target path and material edit together; do not add unlisted files or behavior.
- A new path, expanded scope, or material change requires a revised complete proposed changeset and fresh approval.

## Invocation

Usage: `$team-polish [feature or area] [--review full|lean|solo]`. If the required objective cannot be inferred safely, ask for that single missing decision and wait; do not delegate yet.

## Review Mode

Read `.codex/studio.toml` as the only persistent review-mode source. Map `review_mode = "phase-gated"` to lean gate intensity. A `--review` argument applies only to the current run. Use `.codex/docs/director-gates.md` and `.codex/docs/technical-preferences.md` for native gate and engine context.

## Team Roster

- `performance-analyst`
- `technical-artist`
- `sound-designer`
- `qa-tester`

## Delegation Plan

- Delegate only tasks that are independent and bounded.
- Name the Codex custom-agent role and the exact artifact or evidence it must return.
- Team members must not spawn additional agents (`agents.max_depth = 1`).
- The parent agent synthesizes all results, resolves overlap, and communicates with the user.
- No subagent commits, publishes, or expands scope.
- Parallel delegation is read-only or draft-only until the parent presents a consolidated result.
- Any multi-file implementation requires one complete changeset approval before work begins.
- If a delegated task blocks, surface the evidence and stop dependent work while preserving independent results.

## Pipeline

### Phase 1: Assessment
Delegate to **performance-analyst**:
- Profile the target feature/area using `$perf-profile`
- Identify performance bottlenecks and frame budget violations
- Measure memory usage and check for leaks
- Benchmark against target hardware specs
- Output: performance report with prioritized optimization list

### Phase 2: Optimization
Delegate to **performance-analyst** (with relevant programmers as needed):
- Fix performance hotspots identified in Phase 1
- Optimize draw calls, reduce overdraw
- Fix memory leaks and reduce allocation pressure
- Verify optimizations don't change gameplay behavior
- Output: optimized code with before/after metrics

If Phase 1 identified engine-level root causes (rendering pipeline, resource loading, memory allocator), delegate those fixes to **technical-artist** in parallel:
- Optimize hot paths in engine systems
- Fix allocation pressure in core loops
- Output: engine-level fixes with profiler validation

### Phase 3: Visual Polish (parallel with Phase 2)
Delegate to **technical-artist**:
- Review VFX for quality and consistency with art bible
- Optimize particle systems and shader effects
- Add screen shake, camera effects, and visual juice where appropriate
- Ensure effects degrade gracefully on lower settings
- Output: polished visual effects

### Phase 4: Audio Polish (parallel with Phase 2)
Delegate to **sound-designer**:
- Review audio events for completeness (are any actions missing sound feedback?)
- Check audio mix levels — nothing too loud or too quiet relative to the mix
- Add ambient audio layers for atmosphere
- Verify audio plays correctly with spatial positioning
- Output: audio polish list and mixing notes

### Phase 5: Hardening
Delegate to **qa-tester**:
- Test all edge cases: boundary conditions, rapid inputs, unusual sequences
- Soak test: run the feature for extended periods checking for degradation
- Stress test: maximum entities, worst-case scenarios
- Regression test: verify polish changes haven't broken existing functionality
- Test on minimum spec hardware (if available)
- Output: test results with any remaining issues

### Phase 6: Sign-off
- Collect results from all team members
- Compare performance metrics against budgets
- Report: READY FOR RELEASE / NEEDS MORE WORK
- List any remaining issues with severity and recommendations

## Error Recovery Protocol

If any delegated agent (through Codex custom-agent delegation) returns BLOCKED, errors, or cannot complete:

1. **Surface immediately**: Report "[AgentName]: BLOCKED — [reason]" to the user before continuing to dependent phases
2. **Assess dependencies**: Check whether the blocked agent's output is required by subsequent phases. If yes, do not proceed past that dependency point without user input.
3. **Offer options** via request_user_input with choices:
   - Skip this agent and note the gap in the final report
   - Retry with narrower scope
   - Stop here and resolve the blocker first
4. **Always produce a partial report** — output whatever was completed. Never discard work because one agent blocked.

Common blockers:
- Input file missing (story not found, GDD absent) → redirect to the skill that creates it
- ADR status is Proposed → do not implement; run `$architecture-decision` first
- Scope too large → split into two stories via `$create-stories`
- Conflicting instructions between ADR and story → surface the conflict, do not guess

## Changeset Gate

Delegated agents return drafts or read-only evidence to the parent. The parent synthesizes every proposed edit, lists all affected paths and material changes, and requests one complete changeset approval. After approval, implementation stays within that boundary; any expansion pauses for a revised approval.
## Output

A summary report covering: performance before/after metrics, visual polish changes, audio polish changes, test results, and release readiness assessment.

## Next Steps

- If READY FOR RELEASE: run `$release-checklist` for the final pre-release validation.
- If NEEDS MORE WORK: schedule remaining issues in `$sprint-plan update` and re-run `$team-polish` after fixes.
- Run `$gate-check` for a formal phase gate verdict before handing off to release.
